# 16/07/24 - NameCountriesGame (#1)
This project is a game where the user lists as many countries as they can. The
user can see the number of countries remaining and the countries already named
below the text box.

This is the first project of my daily miniproject series and my first project
using vuejs. After probably hundreds of hours of coding in react, I finally
branch out to another frontend framework and my first impressions of vue are
generally very positive. Here are some thoughts:
- I find it to be quite similar to react so it the transition wasn't too difficult
- The HTML like syntax is very clean and consistent
- Splitting up the component file into the script, template and style
tag makes it very readable
- the conditional and list rendering is super clean with the v-if, v-else etc.
- I still have no idea what bindings are :/
